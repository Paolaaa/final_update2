#I will be plotting spatial data from IUCN endangered bird species on a 
#California map and I will also plot population densities to see if there
#is a correlation between growing population densities and endangered birds
#I was able to download the data for the range maps however the files are 
#shapefiles .shp, .shx, .dbf and I have not been able to figure out how to
#work with them. I worked with the grad students but they didnt know how to
#work with the shape files either.
